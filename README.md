# Chess AI

This is a group project done for Software Engineering 101 at the University of Waterloo. My group partners, Jacob Ledgerwood and Kevin Zhu, and I completed it in our first year of the Software Engineering program (Fall term, 2017).

## Goal

Our goal was to create a one player chess game using an Arduino with an Adafruit Shield. In the end, Our chess AI had an easy mode and a hard mode, which players could switch back and forth between.

## How to use

To run this, you would need to download it to an Arduino (or similar device) that is using an Adafruit Shield. We used the 1.8" 18-bit Color TFT Shield with a MircoSD and Joystick. The player uses the joystick to move a cursor around the displayed chessboard to select what they wished to do next. The player and the computer will alternate turns following the rules of chess. If a checkmate or stalemate is reached, a message will be shown on the display and the player can choose to start a new game.
